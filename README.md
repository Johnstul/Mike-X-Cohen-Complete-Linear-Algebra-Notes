# Mike-X-Cohen-Complete-Linear-Algebra-Notes

(Currently chapter 2 only)

My Python notes / notebooks based on Mike X Cohen's videos on Complete Linear Algebra: Theory and Implementation

All code was originally authored by Mike X Cohen.

I edited and modified the code and transferred over the code and concepts into notebook form.
